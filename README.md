        ```  try{
                    example1.innerHTML = jsonData[0].def[0].sseq[0][0][1].dt[1][1][0].t;
                }catch(err){

                offensive.innerHTML = `Offensive: ${jsonData[0].meta.offensive}`;
            } catch (error) {
                console.log(error);
                errorText.forEach((text) => {
